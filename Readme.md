```javascript
var context = new webkitAudioContext()
  , osc = context.createOscillator()
  , Delay = require("delay")
  , delay = new Delay(context, {
      type: 0,
      delay: 1.0,
      feedback: 0.42,
      offset: -0.027,
      cutoff: 800
    });

osc.connect(delay.input);
delay.connect(context.destination);
osc.start(0);
```

For further examples, see the test files.

## API

### Delay(context, options)
